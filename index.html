                        Hello, my name is Kyle Yumul.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Growing up in a time where technology is found almost everywhere and so easily
                        accessible, I've always been set as working with technology as my career. As an 
                        aspiring software engineer, I am constantly striving to learn how to improve
                        my skills with various coding languages whether its for a class or on my own
                        time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I did not spend time in highschool learning to code or making programs like other 
                        kids who share my interests, but that doesn't mean I am not passionate about
                        computer science. I am hoping to gain the skills to create creative, functional, 
                        and purposeful websites and programs that people can utilize and enjoy at the same
                        time.

                        I am currently a first-year student at the University of Florida in Gainesville. I am pursuing 
                        a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the College of Engineering. My expected graduation 
                        date is in Spring of 2028.

                        I am currently learning Python at the university and I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on 
                        my own time. There are projects that I plan on working on once my skills with these coding 
                        lanugages are refined enough, however my current abilities with these languages are very basic.

                        In collaboration with a close friend and fellow University of Florida student,
                        we are in the process of creating an online shop. This shop would be a way for 
                        her (my friend) to take her once local business and convert it to a statewide
                        operation, with room for expansion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This would be an online shop for custom press-on nails. Potential clients would
                        be able to request press-on nails with any design of their choice. The designs
                        could be original, inspired by designs found online, or be a freestyle design 
                        by the maker at the client's request.
